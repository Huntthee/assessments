## Submission Instructions
1. Take full-screen captures of the Free Code Camp progress screen to show which activities you've completed. Use as many screencaps as neccessary to show that each exercise has a checkmark.
2. In each screencap, make sure you are logged in and that your profile pic is included in the image.
3. Upload your screencaps to Brightspace and include a link to your Free Code Camp profile page in the comments of the submission.

## Marking Rubric
You mark will be proportional to the number of exercises you complete. For example, if you complete half the exercises, your mark will be 15% x 0.5 = 7.5%.

**Suggested Strategy**: To maximize your mark, complete the easiest of the exercises first and go back later to complete the more difficult ones.
