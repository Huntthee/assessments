# DRAFT: Node Final Group Project - Deployed Product/Services Website
In this assignment, your group will deploy a multi-page, database-driven Product website using Express, EJS (or similar view engine) and Mongoose. It will be deployed to Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.

## Instructions
This website will sell/advertise new products/services of your choice that you have not covered in prior assignments in this program.

Note: Since this is not an HTML/CSS assignment, visual components such as hero sections, footers, logos etc may be reused from prior assignments and projects. Only the theme/product/service of the website must be unique for the purposes of this assignment. Existing images may be considered placeholders but **must be served locally** (no lorem picsum).

Design elements will be ignored for this assignment with the exception of:
- Accessible and responsive navigation
- Accessible forms
- Accessible and semantic images
- Responsive galleries and card layouts

Aside from the required endpoints and features defined, you may layout and organize your site as you feel appropriate. 

BUT, please make sure your instructor doesn't have to hunt to find your code...

### Project Setup
While not explicitly listed as assignment criteria, marks will be deducted for projects that are not properly deployed.
- Initialize a new project using npm.
- Dependencies:
  - `express`
  - `ejs` (or similar)
  - `dotenv`
  - `mongoose`
- Serve static assets from a `public` directory.
- Return a custom 404 page when a file (or endpoint) cannot be found.
- Mongoose connection authenticated using `.env` file.
  - .on event for errors
  - .once event for successful connection

## Criteria
5 points will be given for each of the following criteria, for a total of 25 points:

### 1. HTML Endpoints

### 2. Schema/model implementation

### 3. JSON Endpoints

### 4. Frontend `fetch()` implementation

### 5. Individual Contribution
Assign the key roles and responsibilities for each group member in delivering the Final Project. After each entry write a short summary defining their role and what their responsibilities are in the project. 

This charter will serve as the reference for your instructor's evaluation of your individual contribution to the group project.

#### Peer Evaluation
At the end of the Final Project, all team members must evaluate their teammates on a scale of 1-10. Each member's mark for this portion will be the average score given to them by their teammates.

#### Instructor Evaluation
Your instructor will also evaluate the individual contribution of each team member, within the context of the Group Charter. This will be based largely on your commit history for the project.

Things to remember:
- You must have Git properly configured to use your GitHub email address in order for your commits to be associated with your GH account. Without this, you will not receive credit for any work you have completed.
- If you have made contributions to the project that are not reflected in your commit history, please elaborate in your Project README or as a comment when you submit your group evaluation.
- Equal(ish) division of work is required unless there are mitigating circumstances.
