# Assignment 1: Click-through splash page
Scenario: A smoke shop is opening up in your neighbourhood and your friend knows that they're looking for someone to design their website. Knowing that your local bylaws mandate an "Over 18" splash page for smoke shops, you decide to design a demo page for the owner.

## Instructions
Create a scroll-less hero section that contains:
- at least one image, either HTML or CSS;
- at least one gradient;
- a heading, wrapped in a `h1`
- a tagline, wrapped in a `p`
- a click-through `a` element to a website of your choice.

Further requirements are listed below.

### Heading and tagline
- Display the heading and tagline with two different Google Fonts, each with fallbacks for system and generic fonts.
- Text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- `font-size`, `line-height` cannot be at default settings.

### Click-through link
- Link text should:
  - read "I am not a miner";
  - have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1.
- Link element should:
  - look like a button (you may use a `button` element instead of a `a`) and be obviously clickable;
  - have distinct `:hover` and `:active` states declared.

### General requirements
- Responsiveness:
  - no content can flow off the page;
  - text must be readable when overlapping an image;
  - `font-size` should be smaller on mobile (or portrait) screens;
  - a small scroll bar is acceptable.
- Accessibility:
  - no text can touch a visible edge (e.g. a button with a coloured background but no padding);

## Submission Requirements
- Push this assignment to a repo named `cpnt260-a1`.
- ZIP all files required for the site to operate and upload to Brightspace. 
- Leave a link to your GitHub repo as a comment in your Brightspace submission.

## Marking Rubric: 3 marks will be given for each of the following:
1. Code quality
