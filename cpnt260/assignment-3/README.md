## Client User Stories
1. You're an intern at a design agency and you're the only one in the office that can code. A new client asks for a first draft of a one-page website.
2. You are an independent contractor and you just landed your first paying project: a one-page website!
3. You need a website to promote your services. You think a one-page website is the best way to go.
4. A grandparent wants a website to show off their dog?

## Marking Rubric
Each of the following will be marked out of 4 points (for a total of 20 points), based on the requirements below:

### 1. Figure cards
- Semantic images using `figure` and `figcaption`.
  - `figcaption` should contain some form of title, description, photo credit, etc.
  - figcaption should have a `min-width` to preserve line length.
- Content images using `img` elements.
- Lorem Picsum is allowed.
- Photo credits required, even if they're your own work.

### 2. Responsive gallery
- Single column on mobile, three or more columns on desktop.
- Gallery can be implemented with Flex or Grid.
- Media queries should _not_ be used.

### 3. Social links
Add a menu listing at least 3 relevant social media links for your project such as Github, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
- You may link to a random/favourite account if you don't have one set up.
- The menu should be in an unordered list but can be vertical or horizontal, depending on your design.
- The icons can be linked/displayed with a method of your choice, including:
  - Content icon fonts using Font Awesome `i` elements (or similar icon library);
  - Presentation SVG images using `background-image`;
  - Presentation SVG images using pseudo-elements.

### 4. Devops and Deployment

### 5. Project documentation and code quality
- Include a `README.md` in your project that contains the following information:
  - Course title;
  - Author name;
  - Links to:
    - GH repo;
    - GH Pages site
  - Some context on the website (and maybe give him hints on where to look for the requirements above):
    - Who's the client?
    - What's the goal of the site?
  - Attributions for any code or assets that are not your own.
- Use best practices with file/directory names, commenting and indentation:
  - 2 spaces per indent
  - See: [Files and Directories - Naming Conventions](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/winter-2021/cheatsheets/naming-conventions/)
- Accessibility best practices are followed:
  - Page text is readable at all screen widths and does _not_: 
    - overlap any other page elements;
    - exceed a maximum line length of `95ch` or be shorter than `20ch`;
    - overflow off the viewport;
    - have a contrast ratio below _AA_ for its text size.
  - Images should include proper `alt` text attributes.
- Page is marked up with proper semantic elements, when needed.
