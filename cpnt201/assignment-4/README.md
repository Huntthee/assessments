# Assignment 4 - Merge Conflict and `.gitignore`
## Requirements
Each of the following criteria will be marked out of 5 points, for a total of 10 points for the assignment.

### 1. Resolving a merge conflict
1. Follow the instructions in this Gist to create a merge conflict on purpose:
    - [Activity: Git - create a merge conflict](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/d8c2e285c9b25fcb7443a4f0f4e4b4e6)
2. Once you've resolved your git conflict and pushed your up-to-date code to GitHub, take note of the specific commit that resolves the conflict (it has two parents listed [like this one](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/hello-conflict/commit/ecd9a82931e63de43d979a2a957c868ab5e520e1). You will be submitting this link as part of this assignment.
    - Make sure this link points to the commit itself.
    - Confirm that this commit has two parents listed (because it's merging two branches).

### 2. Committed `.gitignore` file
1. Create a `.gitignore` in your merge conflict repo, based on [this one in the `sample-code` repository](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/sample-code/blob/master/.gitignore).
2. `add`, `commit` and `push` this file to the GH repo as part of this assignment.
    - Make sure the file contains the same content as the `.gitignore` from the `sample-code` repository.
