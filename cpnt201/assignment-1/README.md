# Assignment 1 - Three Deployed Git Hub Pages Templates
See [Feedback Key](feedback-key.md)

## Details
In this assignment, you will deploy three _distinct_ static website templates that could be customized for a fictitious business of your choice. 

Scenario: Your potential client will choose their favourite template after an initial requirements meeting.

## Instructions
1. Search online for three _distinct_ static website templates that could be customized for your selected client;
2. Deploy each template to GH Pages, naming each repo "cpnt201-a1-[template-name]";
3. Commit customizations for each template home page.

## Criteria
1. Distinctiveness 
    - Each template should offer a diverse choice for the client by:
        - being visually distinct from the other two templates;
        - representing, collectively, a wide variety of layout elements (cards, sliders, gallery, etc).
2. Functionality
    - Each template should be responsive, and 
    - have the potential to be a multi-page site.
3. Deployment
    - Each template should be deployed using GitHub Pages (_not_ with a chosen theme) and be viewable on a mobile device.
4. Committed Customizations
    - Each template repository should have at least three commits that customizes content on the home page:
        - page titles (commit 1),
        - page headings (commit 2),
        - primary navigation (commit 3).
    - Each change should be captured in its own commit with a descriptive message. 
    - The changes themselves will not be marked but cannot break the design.

## Submitting Your Assignment
In order to receive a grade, you must:
1. Deploy each template to a separate GitHub Pages repository named "cpnt201-a1-[template-name]".
2. Zip your projects/repos and submit them to Brightspace.
3. Include links to each GitHub repo as a comment with your Brightspace submission.
