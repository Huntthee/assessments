# Final Project: Wordpress Website with Elementor
This assignment will be completed in groups of 3-4. You have the freedom to pick the website topic to encourage creativity (and potentially give you ammunition for the Final Presentations). For the purposes of roles and responsibilities, it's up to each group how you delegate tasks.

The project goal is to create a Wordpress CMS, using Elementor, that is deployed on Flywheel.
- Note: Flywheel will be set up similar to Git - one group member will own the site.
- Create an _admin_ for each group member so you can each make contributions independently.

## Example User Stories
1. A business owner needs a website for their store front. The site will require frequent updates and one of their staff recommended Wordpress.
2. One of your friends has an idea for an app and you want to jump in on the ground floor. You know a bit of Wordpress and offer to build the website.
3. A business owner has a legacy website built on a platform that is no longer maintained (end-of-life). They would like the existing design and functionality migrated to Wordpress based on recommendations from their next-door neighbour.

## Marking Rubric
10 points will be given for each of the following criteria, for a total of 50 points:

### 1. Setup
- User Management
  - _admin_ accounts for each team member
  - one _admin_ account for instructor (see submission instructions)
- Settings
  - Update the site title
  - Set the homepage to display a static page and set it to your homepage
  - Permalinks: Set to use the post name
- Create a shortcode for the current year, stated in the site's copyright statement.
  - Code examples were given on Day 5 in the Elementor 101 doc.

### 2. Design System
Create your own design system:
- Disable the default fonts and colors.
- Create:
    - global fonts and colours;
    - a button as a theme style;
    - reusable template that is used on multiple pages (example: footer shown in class).
- Create a mobile friendly navigation menu using the [Header, Footer & Blocks Template](https://wordpress.org/plugins/header-footer-elementor/).

### 3. Content
- Custom logo.
- Image gallery with 9-12 images.
- At least one video.
- One Post for each member of your group (i.e. 4 Posts for a group of 4).
- One Page for each member of your group (i.e. 3 Pages for a group of 3).
  - Each page should be available in your primary navigation.

Content can be your own work or any openly licensed assets.

### 4. Extras
- Add the "Recent Posts" _widget_ somewhere on the site and apply custom CSS for presentation.
- Use five of [the following _widgets_](widgets.png) (marked in green) on each page (can be different widgets on each page)
- Add a form on the website using a _plugin_ with at least 3 fields.
  - Examples:
    - newsletter subscription
    - contact form
    - small survey
  - The form does not have to submit an email but should present a valid confirmation screen after submission.

### 5. Peer Evaluation
At the end of the Final Project, all team members must evaluate their teammates on a scale of 1-10. Each member's mark for this portion will be the average score given to them by their teammates.

#### Group Charter
Assign the key roles and responsibilities for each group member in delivering the Final Project. After each entry write a short summary defining their role and what their responsibilities are in the project. 

This charter will serve to set expectations for the group and course instructor.

## Submission Instructions
- Submit the following to Brightspace as a text submission:
  - your deployed Flywheel link
  - the username/password for the deployed demo site.
- Create an admin account in the WP Admin panel:
  - username: instructor
