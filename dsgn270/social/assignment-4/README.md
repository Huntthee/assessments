# Assignment 4: Business Synopsis - Pirate Metics
Find a local business and evaluate its business model in terms of pirate metrics.
  - the business doesn't have to be local to Calgary;
  - the business can be you;
  - the pirate metrics should involve social media but doesn't have to focus on it.

For the purposes of this assignment, these questions can be answered hypothetically. In other words, the business doesn't have to be doing this at the moment but could (if they hired you).

## Questions to answer
- **Acquisition**
  - How do customers find you? 
  - Who are they? Is this a B2B or B2C relationship?
  - How would an opt-in list be generated?
  - What is the Call-to-Action?
- **Activation**: 
  - How do you/they get a customer to care?
  - What happens when they do?
  - How would this be measured?
- **Retention**: 
  - How is a returning customer defined?
  - How are returning customers measured?
  - How are one-time customers followed up on?
- **Referral**: 
  - How can customers become advocates? 
  - How many are advocates?
  - How is/can this be measured?
- **Revenue**: 
  - How is revenue generated?
  - How is ROI and conversion rate measured?
  - Are there any upsell opportunities?

## Instructions
- Summarize the company's business goal in one sentence.

  - Write a short description (three to five sentences/bullet points) that answers the questions for each metric.
  - Include examples (links) from the business itself or from similar/competing businesses.
  - Reference any tools that could/would be used to measure the metric.

## Marking rubric
5 points will be given for each of the five AARRR descriptions, for a total of 25 points.
- Are the questions effectively answered?
