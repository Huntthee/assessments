# Assignment 1: Website Critique
Select a public, multi-page website of your choice. Write a 600-750 word critique evaluating of this website, based on the terminology and concepts you've learned in this course.

## Questions to think about
Base your critique on the following criteria.
1. Usability
    - Is the navigation intuitive? How wide or shallow is it?
    - What convension does the site implement or violate?
    - Is the body text readable? Why or why not?
2. Visual Hierarchy
    - What is your overall impression of the site visuals?
    - Is the content scannable? Is there an obvious Call to Action?
    - What are some visual hierarchy priciples that the site implements? Does it violate any?
3. Mobile Friendliness
    - Is the content responsive? Is there content parity?
    - Does the mobile site take advantage of any phone-specific features or capabilites?
    - Does the site make effective use of cards?
    
You _do not_ need to answer every question and you may use some of your own.
