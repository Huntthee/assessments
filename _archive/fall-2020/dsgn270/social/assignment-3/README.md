# Assignment 3 - Community of Practice Micro-essay
Find an individual or organization that is using open social tools (including Youtube, Twitch, etc) to _teach_ a skill or craft that you would like to learn or could teach yourself.

Note: A community of practice _actively_ teaches a craft. A gamer that only streams their games is not actively teaching unless they have something that resembles lessons, like [Day 9](https://day9.tv/). 

## Micro-essay
In 280 _characters_ (**not words**), summarize their:
1. Audience: What are they teaching? What are the audience goals?
2. Media: How are they teaching it? What online social tools are they using to deliver their main content (Youtube, podcast, IG, Facebook)?
3. Differentiation: What are they doing that distinguishes them from other similar content?

## Supporting Share Links
Include 5 "share" links (i.e. minified links using something like `bit.ly` or the social tool's native link minifier) that illustrate their use of social media.
- These links will not count toward the 280 characters.
- You may use timestamps if the tool supports it:
  - Example: `https://youtu.be/L7e0tkXPOjA?t=216`
- Include one hashtag of up to 15-characters (including hyphens but _not_ the `#`) to give your link some context. This hastag should be on the same line as your link, separated by a space.
  - Example: `https://youtu.be/L7e0tkXPOjA?t=216 #yay-sponsors` 
- You may include share links from competing services/content.

## Submission Instructions
