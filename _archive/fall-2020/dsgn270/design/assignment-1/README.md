# Assignment 1: Website Review
Choose a local kitchen (restaurant, pub, tap room, etc) and write a 600-750 word review evaluating their website based on the terminology and concepts you've learned in this course:

1. Visual Hierarchy

    - What is the goal of the website?
    - Does the website make effective use of visual hierarchy? Why or why not?
2. Mental Models and Usability
    - Are there any violations of convention?
    - Is the content scannable?
    - Is the body text readable? Are there any example of text with too low of a contrast ratio.
4. Mobile Responsiveness
    - Is there a scroll track on mobile devices.
    - Does the business have an online menu? If so, is it responsive? Can the menu be bookmarked for use in a QR Code?
