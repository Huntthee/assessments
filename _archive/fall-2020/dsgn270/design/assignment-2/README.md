# DSGN 270: Assignment 2 - Proposal One-pager
## Details
In this assignment, you will layout a one-page critique/proposal of a business website of your choice. This may be the same client/business you focused on in previous assignments or completely new business.

**Scenario**: You've identified a potential client that has expressed interest in a critique of their current website. Knowing the client is a busy business owner, it's important the critique is concise and scannable; they have requested a one-page PDF outlining your points.

You will make three evaluations based on any of the criteria you've learned in this course:
- Visual hierarchy
- Mental models and convention
- Responsiveness
- Performance

## Instructions
Using a design or layout program of your choice, create an esthetically designed document using the concepts you learned in this course. For example, use the principles of visual hierarchy to present your critique in a scannable format for the potential client. 

### Required Page Elements
1. A document title mentioning the business name;
2. A short introduction that includes:
    - the date of the critique;
    - the author of the document (you or the name of your company);
    - the purpose of the document, from the perspective of the client (increasing sales, usability for customers, etc).
3. Three critiques of the website that EACH include:
    - a _single_ principle or criteria that the web site could improve on;
    - an image or illustration;
    - a heading summarizing the critique (e.g. "Home Page Lacks White/Negative Space" or similar);
    - a two or three sentence description of the problem and recommended solution(s).
    - a link to the live page in question, if appropriate.
4. A short conclusion summarizing next steps and contact information for further discussion. This section should encourage the reader to hire you for a redesign.

## Submitting Your Assignment
In order to receive a grade, you must:
1. Export your document in PDF format (so it can be emailed and read without special software).
2. Zip your PDF and submit it to Brightspace (you do not need to create a repo for this assignment).
3. As a comment, include a link to the live website that you critiqued.

## Marking Rubric
This assignment will be marked out of 25 points.

### Visual Design: 10 points 
Your page should be scannable for the potential client to quickly grasp your points.
- Does the overall design grab the attention of the reader?
- Are the 3 critiques visually distinct? In other words, is there obvious visual separation between points 1, 2 and 3 (using size and scale, for example)?
- Is there too much content for one-page?
- Is there an adequate title, introduction and conclusion based on the requirements above?

### Each Critique: 5 points (15 points total)
1. Title: 1 point
    - Does it mention the criteria in question (for example: "Performance", "Typography", "Hamburger Menu", etc)?
2. Image: 2 points
    - Does it adequately illustrate the point of the critique?
    - Is it properly balanced in relation to the other page elements? For example, is it too large to allow for whitespace separation?
3. Critique: 2 points
    - Is the problem concisely described? For example, will it be clear to the reader why they need your help?
    - Is your proposed solution _actionable_? For example, is it obvious to the reader how you will solve the problem if they hire you?
