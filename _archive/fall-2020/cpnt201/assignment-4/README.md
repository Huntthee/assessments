# Assignment 4: Git Collaboration
This assignment represents the individual contribution mark for the [CPNT 262 Final Group Project](../../cpnt262/final).

## Group Charter
Assign the key roles and responsibilities for each group member in delivering the Final Project for CPNT 262. After each entry write a short summary defining their role and what their responsibilities are in the project. 

This charter will serve as the reference for your instructor's evaluation of your individual contribution to the group project.

### Group Evaluation
At the end of the Final Project, all team members must evaluate their teammates on a scale of 1-10. Each member's mark for this portion will be the average score given to them by their teammates.

### Instructor Evaluation
Your instructor will also evaluate the individual contribution of each team member, within the context of the Group Charter. This will be based largely on your commit history for the project.

Things to remember:
- You must have Git properly configured to use your GitHub email address in order for your commits to be associated with your GH account. Without this, you will not receive credit for any work you have completed.
- If you have made contributions to the project that are not reflected in your commit history, please elaborate in your Project README or as a comment when you submit your group evaluation.
- Equal(ish) division of work is required unless there are mitigating circumstances.

## Marking Rubric
This assignment will be marked out of 25 points.
- **10 points**: Group Evaluation
- **15 points**: Instructor Evaluation
